üõçÔ∏è Retail Sales Data Analytics & Power BI Dashboard

This project demonstrates an end-to-end retail analytics workflow:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation (SQL)

project.sql ‚Äì Creates a MySQL database RetailSalesData with two tables:

Sales_Data_transcation ‚Äì stores each customer transaction (customer_id, trans_date, trans_amount).

Sales_Data_Response ‚Äì stores each customer‚Äôs response flag.

Includes a LOAD DATA INFILE command to bulk-load CSV transaction data.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration (Jupyter Notebook)

dataprj (4).ipynb ‚Äì Python notebook for preliminary analysis and transformation of the retail dataset before visualisation.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Interactive Dashboards (Power BI)

Scatter plot of responses vs. transaction dates, yearly sales bar chart, and pie chart of responses by year.

These dashboards provide actionable insights such as top-spending customers, yearly sales performance, and customer engagement levels.

Tech Stack:

MySQL for data storage and ingestion

Python (pandas, Jupyter) for data cleaning and analysis

Microsoft Power BI for interactive reporting

How to Use:

Run project.sql in MySQL to create and populate tables.

Explore or preprocess data with dataprj (4).ipynb.
